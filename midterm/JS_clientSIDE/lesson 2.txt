programmatic constructs (javaScript)
- DOM is NOT a part of javaScript
functionalities:
Javascript is an impeerative programming language
-> dynamically type language
> var a = 100
> typeOF a
RESULT: "number"
-> data types are not explicitly defined
ECMA Script 5
variables:
a. var 	- variables with a 'var' keyword becomes a global variable
b. let 	- variable only exists within the block (similar since i is only accessible in the for-loop where it was instantiated)
		- veriable is NOT associated w/ windows -> for (int i){}
c. const - new values can  NOT be changed
		- doesn't introduct a global property of the variable
e.g.	a = 100
		RESULT: 100
		window.a
		RESULT: 100
(1)
var a = 10;
function f(){
	var a = 20;
	console.log(a);
	{
		var a = 30;
		console.log(a);
	}
		console.log(a);
}
RESULT:
f():	10
		20
		30
		
(2)
