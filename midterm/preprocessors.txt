CSS PREPROCESSORS
	Pre-processors, with their advanced features, helped to achieve writing reusable, maintainable and extensible codes in CSS. By using a pre-processor, you can easily increase your productivity, and decrease the amount of code you are writing in a project.

	Variables
-	All time features for CSS
-	div {
    		font-size: 16px;
	}

	Nesting
-	Nesting provides a visual hierarchy as in the HTML and increases the readability.
-	ul { margin: 0; }
	ul li { float: left; }
	ul a { color: #999; }
	ul a:hover { color: #229ed3; }

	Extends
-	Extends are useful for sharing a generic definition with selectors rather than copying it in. All extended selectors are grouped in compiled CSS.
-	.block, p, ul, ol { margin: 10px 5px; }

	p { border: 1px solid #eee; }
	ul, ol { color: #333; text-transform: uppercase; }
