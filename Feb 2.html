			<h3>Request</h3>
			
			<p>Request Line (CRLF - terminated line consiting of three space-seperated)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Method - indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the Request-URI.
				The method is case-sensitive.</li>
				<li>Request URI - a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.</li>
				<li>HTTP Protocol Version -  is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems.
				HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Message header (general, request, and/or entity headers)</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>HTTP 1.1 requires at least the Host request header to be provided.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Empty Line  (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields.</p>
			
			<p>Message Body aka. Payload(optional) - is used to carry the entity-body associated with the request or response.
			The message-body differs from the entity-body only when a transfer-coding has been applied,
			as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding header field </p>
			
			<h3>HTTP Respond Message</h3>
			
			<p>Status Line - consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase,
			with each element separated by SP characters. No CR or LF is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>HTTP Protocol Version -  is intended to allow the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for
				understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features obtained via that communication.</li>
				<li>Status Code - is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request. </li>
				<li>Reason Phrase - is intended to give a short textual description of the Status-Code.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Message Headers</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process</li>
			</ul>
			
			<ol>
				<li>"100" : Continue</li>

			<h3>HTTP Respond Methods</h3>
			
			<p>Standard Method - The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1.
			Although this set can be expanded, additional methods cannot be assumed to share the same semantics for separately
			extended clients and servers.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Get</li>
				<li>Head</li>
				<li>Post</li>
				<li>Put</li>
				<li>Delete</li>
				<li>Options</li>
				<li>Trace</li>
				<li>Connect</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Extension Methods - safe methods, idempotend method, cacheable method.
			Example is WebDAV (RFC 4918) - Profind, Propatch, Mkcol, Copy, Move, Lock, Unlock.</p>
			
			<p>Standard Method</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Get - means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI.
				If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as
				the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output
				of the process.</li>
				<li>Head - is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response.
				The metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to
				the information sent in response to a GET request. This method can be used for obtaining metainformation
				about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is often
				used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.</li>
				<li>Post - s used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as
				a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.</li>
				<li>Put - requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.
				If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be
				considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.</li>
				<li>Delete - requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI.
				This method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server.
				The client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code returned
				from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed successfully.</li>
			</ul>
