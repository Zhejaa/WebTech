				<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
				
					<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</p>
					
				<h3>What is HTML's role in modern web development?</h3>
				
					<h4>HTML - the structure and framework</h4>
					
					<p>This will be the walls, roof and foundation of a house.</p>
					
					<p>HTML (Hyper Text Mark-Up Language) is pretty much an element referencing
					language, we declare tags and elements that justify the structure and layout of a site.</p>
					
					<h4>CSS - the beautifying</h4>
					
					<p>Now that the house is built and the structure is sturdy, you can paint it.
					Paint the doors, window frames and roof. Get some plants and shit. Do some landscaping,
					get a fountain - you'll need javascript to get that pump working though.</p>
					
					<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) is the styling language that determines how your site looks.</p>
					
					<h4>Javascript - The infrastructure</h4>
					
					<p>Now, we need the lights to work and the pipes to flow with running water. 
					Hook up to the grid and get things working.</p>
					
					<p>Javascript is an object orientating language, basically what this means is that javascript
					can interact or change the state of objects/elements of a webpage. It interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model),
					which is essentially the rendered code the browser has compiled and loaded to appear on your screen.</p>
					
				<h3>Who invented HTML?</h3>
				
					<h4>Tim Berners-Lee</h4>
					
					<p>HTML was invented by Tim Berners-Lee, a British Engineer, Computer Scientist and Professor at MIT in 1991.
					Post his invention Tim Berners-Lee came to be known as the ‘father of web’. Berners-Lee is the founder of World Wide Web Foundation
					and is also the director of World Wide Web Consortium, W3C.</p>
					
				<h3>Who oversees the development?</h3>
				
					<h4>W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)</h4>
					
					<p>The W3C is the source for most of the recommendations that concern web developers. They produce recommendations for the
					implementation of such technologies as XHTML, the Document Object Model, and Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
					
				<h3>What are the versions of HTML?</h3>
				
					<h4>HTML 1.0 (1989 - 1994)</h4>
					
						<p>The first version of HTML that supported inline images and text controls. HTML 1.0 was very limited in terms of styling
						and presentation of content.</p>
						
					<h4>HTML 2.0 (1995)</h4>
					
						<p>This specification supported more browsers. HTML 2.0 was considerably improved to support.</p>
						
					<h4>HTML 3.20 (1997)</h4>
					
						<p>This version included support for creating tables and expanded options for form elements. This version also allowed
						web pages to include complex mathematical equations.</p>
						
					<h4>HTML 4.01 (1999)</h4>
					
						<p>. HTML 4.01 focused on separating presentation styling information from the actual content by the use of style sheets as
						HTML 3.20 resulted in difficult maintenance because presentation styling information was included directly in the webpage.
						In HTML 4.0 with the use of style sheets, it is now possible to change the appearance/look of the website by changing just
						the style sheet (s) itself. In comparison, in the earlier versions of HTML making the same changes for the entire website
						meant changing the styling information in the individual pages.</p>
						
				<h3>Which documents specify the HTML standards?</h3>
				
					<p>An HTML 4 document is composed of three parts:</p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>A line containing HTML version information</li>
						<li>A declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element)</li>
						<li>A body, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element or the FRAMESET element.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>White space (spaces, newlines, tabs, and comments) may appear before or after each section. Sections 2 and 3 should be delimited by the HTML element.</p>
					
					<p>Here's an example of a simple HTML document:</p>
					
					<pre>
					
						&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
						   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
						&lt;HTML&gt;
						   &lt;HEAD&gt;
							  &lt;TITLE&gt;My first HTML document&lt;/TITLE&gt;
						   &lt;/HEAD&gt;
						   &lt;BODY&gt;
							  &lt;P&gt;Hello world!
						   &lt;/BODY&gt;
						&lt;/HTML&gt;

					
					</pre>
					
				<h3>What is the syntax of HTML?</h3>
				
					<img src="Elements.png" alt="Syntax HTML" height="140" width="280">
					 
					 <p>For opening a simple element with a start tag</p>
					 
					 <ol>
						<li>it starts with <</li>
						<li>then a list of characters without space, the tagname (or element)</li>
						<li>ends usually with a >.</li>
					 </ol>
					 
					<p>Then closing the simple element with a end tag</p>
					 
					 <ol>
						<li>it starts with </</li>
						<li>then the same list of characters without space, the tagname (or element)</li>
						<li>ends usually with a >.</li>
					 </ol>
