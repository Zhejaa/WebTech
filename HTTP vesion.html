		<ol>
			<li>HTTP 0.9: The One-Line Protocol</li>
			<ul>
				
				<li>The original HTTP proposal by Tim Berners-Lee was designed with simplicity in mind as to help with the adoption of his other nascent idea: the World Wide Web. The strategy appears to have worked: aspiring protocol designers, take note</li>
				<li>It consist of 3 methods: Get, Head, POst</li>
			</ul>

			<li>HTTP/1.0: Rapid Growth and Informational RFC</li>
			<ul>
				
				<li>The period from 1991 to 1995 is one of rapid coevolution of the HTML specification, a new breed of software known as a "web browser," and the emergence and quick growth of the consumer-oriented public Internet infrastructure.</li>
				<li>It consist all 8 methods</li>
			</ul>

			<li>HTTP/1.1: Internet Standard</li>
			<ul>
				
				<li>The HTTP/1.1 standard resolved a lot of the protocol ambiguities found in earlier versions and introduced a number of critical performance optimizations: keepalive connections, chunked encoding transfers, byte-range requests, additional caching mechanisms, transfer encodings, and request pipelining.</li>
				<li>The work on turning HTTP into an official IETF Internet standard proceeded in parallel with the documentation effort around HTTP/1.0 and happened over a period of roughly four years: between 1995 and 1999. In fact, the first official HTTP/1.1 standard is defined in RFC 2068, which was officially released in January 1997, roughly six months after the publication of HTTP/1.0. Then, two and a half years later, in June of 1999, a number of improvements and updates were incorporated into the standard and were released as RFC 2616.</li>
			</ul>

			<li>HTTP/2: Improving Transport Performance</li>
			<ul>
				
				<li>The primary focus of HTTP/2 is on improving transport performance and enabling both lower latency and higher throughput. The major version increment sounds like a big step, which it is and will be as far as performance is concerned, but it is important to note that none of the high-level protocol semantics are affected: all HTTP headers, values, and use cases are the same.</li>
